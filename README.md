# AB_Test
EDA: https://public.tableau.com/profile/nikanshi.yadav#!/vizhome/ABTestLandingPages/Dashboard1?publish=yes

The dataset contains clickstream data for two landing pages - old_page & new_page 
The length of the A/B experiment is 24 days.
Total 294478 occurs out of which were by unique visitors.
The number of sessions for old_page & new_page is almost equal - a prerequisite for unbiased A/B Test
We're testing to see if conversion rates are significantly  different for the two landing pages
Null Hypothesis: Conversion Probability of old_page = Conversion Probability of new_page
Alternative Hypothesis: Conversion Probability of old_page != Conversion Probability of new_page
I used Z-score calculation and Logistic Regression to test the hypothesis
